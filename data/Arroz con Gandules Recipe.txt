Arroz con Gandules Recipe

2 cups long or short grain rice (rinsed)
3 1/2 cups of boiling water
1 1/2 cups of chorizo (sliced bite size)
2 Tablespoons of sofrito
1 pound of gandules (pigeon peas)
1 tablespoon of alcaparrado without liquid
1 ounce Jamon de cocinar (Cooking ham or smoked ham)
1 one packet of Sazon with achiote
4 ounces of tomato sauce
2 Tablespoons of oilSalt to taste

Chorizo can be substituted with tocino (salt fatback crackling's) and jamon de
cocinar (smoked cooking ham). If you are going to use the tocino be sure not
to use too much salt to the rice because the tocino is salty.

Sofrito: 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 Banana or Bell pepper (chopped in fine 
pieces), 1 teaspoonful oregano, 3 Culantro leaves (chopped), 1 medium onion 
(chopped), and 2-3 Aji dulce.

In a Dutch oven pot with lid fry the Tocino (pork fat) or Chorizo in oil. Add
the tomato sauce, alcaparrado, sofrito and sazon to the pot and stir together. 
Cook at medium heat for 4 minutes. Add all other ingredients except the salt, 
pour the boiling water into the pot so the rice is submerged one inch below the 
water. Start with 1 teaspoon of salt stir and keep adding and mixing well until 
you are satisfied with the taste. Don't cover yet; let the rice absorb the water.
Once absorbed stir gently from bottom to top, cover and turn the heat down to 
low. Stirring once in between, cook for 25 to 30 minutes or until the rice is 
tender. Cover the Arroz con Gandules with Banana leaves while cooking for that 
Caribbean flavor! Serves 3 to 4.
